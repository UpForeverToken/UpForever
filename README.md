# UpForever

This is the token contract for UpForever, the presale is on Tuesday 2.30 pm UTC!

The token contract burns some tokens directly from the pancakeswap LP every time someone sells, thus decreasing the supply of tokens in the LP and slightly increasing the price, but the price in just ofset to the decrease in price from selling, the price will still overall decrease, but less than if this feature wasn't implemented:

Buying 1M tokens: increases the price by 10%
Selling 1M tokens: decreases the price by 2% (otherwise it would be ~10%)
